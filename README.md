# Class file metrics
This is a simple tool to determine properties of class files.
It is mainly used as an analyzer for results of the [Java Bytecode Reducer](https://github.com/jku-ssw/java-bytecode-reducer).
For parsing, the bytecode manipulation library *Javassist* is used.
The application is written in Scala just for fun.
